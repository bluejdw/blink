The Blinky App is written by Vorago.  It's their code.

The build-aparatus and the customizations to the `.ld` file and the startup code is mine based in reinterpration of
the MDK startup code and the default ARM CoreM4 examples.

Doesn't matter.  To whomever -- for whatever you wrote, you already have the licenses dictated.  Level up!
